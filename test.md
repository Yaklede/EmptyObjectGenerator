## What's EmptyObjectGenerator?

EmptyObjectGenerator is a Kotlin utility class that automatically generates objects with desired default values. It
inherently supports Kotlin's primitive types and extends its support to 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional arrays.
Additionally, users have the flexibility to add custom support.
